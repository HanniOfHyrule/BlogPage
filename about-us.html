              <p>
                I love paint, I love art, i love development and creating new
                things. I love that I get to do this. I am just a girl that
                loves what she does. blog was created in the course of further
                training as a software developer. Art and software development
                are not that dissimilar. In both worlds beautiful things are
                created and creative solutions are sought. Every day something
                new is created and everyone can do it with their own approach.
                The best thing about it is that you learn a lot in both worlds
                every day. About the object itself, but also about yourself.
                That's what I love, the constant change.

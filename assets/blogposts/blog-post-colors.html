            <h3>Blue in culture</h3>

              The colour blue has been important in culture, politics, art and
              fashion since ancient times. Blue was used in ancient Egypt for
              jewellery and ornament. In the Renaissance, blue pigments were
              prized for paintings and fine blue and white porcelain. in the
              Middle Ages, deep rich blues made with cobalt were used in stained
              glass windows. In the 19th century, the colour was often used for
              military uniforms and fashion. As the colour that most symbolized
              harmony, blue was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United
              Nations and the European Union. Surveys in the US and Europe show
              that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony,
              faithfulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination,
              cold, and occasionally with sadness.

            <p>
              In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular
              colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their
              favourite colour.The same surveys also showed that blue was the
              colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black,
              and was also the colour most associated with intelligence,
              knowledge, calm, and concentration. Blue was a latecomer among
              colours used in art and decoration, as well as language and
              literature.Reds, blacks, browns, and ochres are found in cave
              paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period, but not blue. Blue
              was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red, ochre,
              pink and purple. This is probably due to the perennial difficulty
              of making good blue dyes and pigments. The earliest known blue
              dyes were made from plants – woad in Europe, indigo in Asia and
              Africa, while blue pigments were made from minerals, usually
              either lapis lazuli or azurite. Lapis lazuli, a semi-precious
              stone, has been mined in Afghanistan for more than three thousand
              years, and was exported to all parts of the ancient world.

              glazed faience ornaments have been found to have been produced
              during 4th millennium civilization Indus Valley civilization
              (present day India and Pakistan).In Iran and Mesopotamia, it was
              used to make jewellery and vessels. In Egypt, it was used for the
              eyebrows on the funeral mask of King Tutankhamun. Importing lapis
              lazuli by caravan across the desert from Afghanistan to Egypt was
              very expensive. Beginning in about 2500 BC, the ancient Egyptians
              began to produce their own blue pigment known as Egyptian blue by
              grinding silica, lime, copper, and alkalai, and heating it to 800
              or 900 °C (1,470 or 1,650 °F). This is considered the first
              synthetic pigment. Egyptian blue was used to paint wood, papyrus
              and canvas, and was used to colour a glaze to make faience beads,
              inlays, and pots. It was particularly used in funeral statuary and
              figurines and in tomb paintings. Blue was considered a beneficial
              colour which would protect the dead against evil in the afterlife.
              Blue dye was also used to colour the cloth in which mummies were
              wrapped.

              In Egypt blue was associated with the sky and with divinity. The
              Egyptian god Amun could make his skin blue so that he could fly,
              invisible, across the sky. Blue could also protect against evil;
              many people around the Mediterranean still wear a blue amulet,
              representing the eye of God, to protect them from misfortune. Blue
              glass was manufactured in Mesopotamia and Egypt as early as 2500
              BC, using the same copper ingredients as Egyptian blue pigment.
              They also added cobalt, which produced a deeper blue, the same
              blue produced in the Middle Ages in the stained glass windows of
              the cathedrals of Saint-Denis and Chartres. The Ishtar Gate of
              ancient Babylon was decorated with deep blue glazed bricks used as
              a background for pictures of lions, dragons and aurochs.

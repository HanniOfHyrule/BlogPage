              The first example of modernism in painting was impressionism, a
              school of painting that invitially focused on work done, not in
              studios, but outdoors (en plein air). Impressionist paintings
              demonstrated that human beings do not see objects, but instead see
              light itself. The school gathered adherents despite internal
              divisions among its leading practitioners and became increasingly
              influential.

              Initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the
              time, the government-sponsored Paris Salon, the Impressionists
              organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the
              1870s and 1880s, timing them to coincide with the official Salon.
              A significant event of 1863 was the Salon des Refusés, created by
              Emperor Napoleon III to display all of the paintings rejected by
              the Paris Salon. Where claude monet also exhibited his works in
              this Salon.

              At the first exhibition, in 1874, Monet displayed, among others,
              Impression, Sunrise, The Luncheon and Boulevard des Capucines.[43]
              The art critic Louis Leroy wrote a hostile review. Taking
              particular notice of Impression, Sunrise (1872), a hazy depiction
              of Le Havre port and stylistic detour, he coined the term
              "Impressionism". Conservative critics and the public derided the
              group, with the term initially being ironic and denoting the
              painting as unfinished. More progressive critics praised the
              depiction of modern life—Louis Edmond Duranty called their style a
              "revolution in painting". He later regretted inspiring the name,
              as he believed that they were a group "whose majority had nothing
              impressionist". The total attendance is estimated at 3500. Monet
              priced Impression: Sunrise at 1000 francs but failed to sell it.
              The exhibition was open to anyone prepared to pay 60 francs and
              gave artists the opportunity to show their work without the
              interference of a jury.
            </p>

              Another exhibition was held in 1876, again in opposition to the
              Salon. Monet displayed 18 paintings, including The Beach at
              Sainte-Adresse which showcased multiple Impressionist
              characteristics.For the third exhibition, on 5 April 1877, he
              selected seven paintings from the dozen he had made of Gare
              Saint-Lazare in the past three months, the first time he had
              "synced as many paintings of the same site, carefully coordinating
              their scenes and temporalities". The paintings were well received
              by critics, who especially praised the way he captured the arrival
              and departures of the trains. By the fourth exhibition his
              involvement was by means of negotiation on Caillebotte's part. His
              last time exhibiting with the Impressionists was in 1882—four
              years before the final Impressionist exhibition.

              Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Morisot, Cézanne and Sisley proceeded to
              experiment with new methods of depicting reality. They rejected
              the dark, contrasting lighting of romantic and realist paintings,
              in favour of the pale tones of their peers' paintings such as
              those by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Boudin. After developing
              methods for painting transient effects, Monet would go on to seek
              more demanding subjects, new patrons and collectors; his paintings
              produced in the early 1870s left a lasting impact on the movement
              and his peers—many of whom moved to Argenteuil as a result of
              admiring his depiction.

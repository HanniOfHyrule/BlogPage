              Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or
              other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix" or
              "support"). The medium is commonly applied to the base with a
              brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and
              airbrushes, can be used. In art, the term painting describes both
              the act and the result of the action (the final work is called "a
              painting"). The support for paintings includes such surfaces as
              walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper
              and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other
              materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and
              even whole objects.

              is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such
              as drawing, composition, gesture (as in gestural painting),
              narration (as in narrative art), and abstraction (as in abstract
              art).Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in
              still life and landscape painting), photographic, abstract,
              narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in
              Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism). A portion
              of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is
              dominated by religious art. Examples of this kind of painting
              range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to
              Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the
              life of Buddha (or other images of Eastern religious origin).

              The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old,
              found in both the Franco-Cantabrian region in western Europe, and
              in the caves in the district of Maros (Sulawesi, Indonesia). In
              November 2018, however, scientists reported the discovery of the
              then-oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as
              old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of
              Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the Indonesian island of Borneo
              (Kalimantan). In December 2019, figurative cave paintings
              depicting pig hunting in the Maros-Pangkep karst in Sulawesi were
              estimated to be even older, at at least 43,900 years old. The
              finding was noted to be “the oldest pictorial record of
              storytelling and the earliest figurative artwork in the world”.
              More recently, in 2021, cave art of a pig found in an Indonesian
              island, and dated to over 45,500 years, has been reported.

              However, the earliest evidence of the act of painting has been
              discovered in two rock-shelters in Arnhem Land, in northern
              Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites, there
              are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old.
              Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting
              preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the Kimberley region of
              North-Western Australia, that is dated 40,000 years old. There are
              examples of cave paintings all over the world—in Indonesia,
              France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, China,India, Australia, Mexico,
              etc. In Western cultures, oil painting and watercolor painting
              have rich and complex traditions in style and subject matter. In
              the East, ink and color ink historically predominated the choice
              of media, with equally rich and complex traditions.

              invention of photography had a major impact on painting. In the
              decades after the first photograph was produced in 1829,
              photographic processes improved and became more widely practiced,
              depriving painting of much of its historic purpose to provide an
              accurate record of the observable world. A series of art movements
              in the late 19th and early 20th centuries—notably Impressionism,
              Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, and
              Dadaism—challenged the Renaissance view of the world. Eastern and
              African painting, however, continued a long history of stylization
              and did not undergo an equivalent transformation at the same
              time.[citation needed] Modern and Contemporary art has moved away
              from the historic value of craft and documentation in favour of
              concept. This has not deterred the majority of living painters
              from continuing to practice painting either as a whole or part of
              their work.
            </p>
            <p>
              The vitality and versatility of painting in the 21st century defy
              the previous "declarations" of its demise. In an epoch
              characterized by the idea of pluralism, there is no consensus as
              to a representative style of the age. Artists continue to make
              important works of art in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic
              temperaments—their merits are left to the public and the
              marketplace to judge.

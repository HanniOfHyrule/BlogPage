          <h3>Blue in culture</h3>
          <p>
            The colour blue has been important in culture, politics, art and
            fashion since ancient times. Blue was used in ancient Egypt for
            jewellery and ornament. In the Renaissance, blue pigments were
            prized for paintings and fine blue and white porcelain. In the
            Middle Ages, deep rich blues made with cobalt were used in stained
            glass windows. In the 19th century, the colour was...

          <h6>Modernism painting</h6>
          <p>
            The first example of modernism in painting was impressionism, a
            school of painting that initially focused on work done, not in
            studios, but outdoors (en plein air). Impressionist paintings
            demonstrated that human beings do not see objects, but instead see
